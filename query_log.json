Cosine Similarity Formula: cos(\u0398)= A.B \u00f7||A||\u00d7||B|| Let us know, how it works; Here A.B is the dot product (it is a way to combine them into a single number of two vectors are combined into a single number). Example, consider these vectors; Vector A= [a1, a2, an] and Vector B= [b1, b2, bn] then; A. B= a1*b1+ a2*b2+\u2026+ an*bn ||A|| and ||B|| are the length (Euclidean norm) of a vector from the distance of origin to the point represented by the vector. Example, if a vector A = [a1, a2, a3, \u2026an] then: ||A|| = \u221aa12+a22\u2026+an2 Example, let us say; A = [3,2,0,5] Then the magnitude is: ||A|| = \u221a32+22+02+52 \u221a38 = 6.16(Approx) This value tells us the \"length\" of the arrow from the origin [0, 0, 0, 0] to [3, 2, 0, 5]. Real-Life Example of Cosine\n---\n Similarity: Movie Recommendation Using Cosine Similarity Suppose you are building a movie recommendation system. Two users have rated the same 5 movies. We want to check how similar their tastes are using cosine similarity. Step1: Covert these ratings into vectors: User 1= [5,4,0,5,3] and User 2= [4,5,0,4,2] Step 2: Dot product (A.B) = (5x4) + (4\u00d75) + (0\u00d70) + (5\u00d74) + (3\u00d72) = 20 + 20 + 0 + 20 + 6 = 66 Step 3: Magnitude of A =\u221a(5\u00b2 + 4\u00b2 + 0\u00b2 + 5\u00b2 + 3\u00b2) = \u221a(25 + 16 + 0 + 25 + 9 = \u221a75 \u2248 8.66 Step 4: Magnitude of B = \u221a(4\u00b2 + 5\u00b2 + 0\u00b2 + 4\u00b2 + 2\u00b2) = \u221a(16 + 25 + 0 + 16 + 4) = \u221a61 \u2248 7.81 Step 5: Cosine Similarity = 66 / (8.66 \u00d7 7.81) = 66 / 67.62 \u2248 0.976 Now you can conclude that cosine similarity value close to 1 means that User 1 and User 2 have very similar movie preferences and we can recommend movies to one user based on the other\u2019s choices.

Sparse Retrieval: also known as sparse neural search, is an approach to information retrieval that uses sparse vector (A sparse vector is a list of numbers where most of the values are zero) representations of queries and documents. Sparse retrieval represents queries and documents as high-dimensional vectors (this list has a lot of numbers hundreds, thousands, or even millions of dimensions) where most values are zero. It uses traditional IR techniques like BM25. Characteristics of sparse retrieval: 1. Search on the basis of keywords: it works by matching exact words instead of searching through meaning between the query and the document, like if your query contains the word \u201cbanana\u201d, it will only retrieve documents that also contain the term \u201cbanana\u201d. 2. \n---\nThe Flocard leaderboard shows top users by Flocoin earnings.

Why is it used in AI search? A vector embedding is a way to turn words or sentences into numbers so that a computer can understand their meaning, it contributes in finding similar things. Vector embedding are numerical representations of texts, images or other forms of data where each object is transformed into a list of numbers called a vector in a multi-dimensional space, It just means there are many features being tracked at once, each dimension represents specific feature of the data like its meaning, emotion, context. Vectors are nothing but list of numbers, and we need a way to match meanings, not just words, that\u2019s what embeddings do. Let us assume computers as human and the scenario while searching will be, the sentences that are close in terms of meaning, the computer concludes that they\u2019re probably talking about the same thing. Example: Let us suppose Dog\u2019s vector [0.23, 0.99, -0.12, ..., 0.77] and Cat\u2019s vector [0.24, 0.98, -0.11, ..., 0.76], these numbers are called embeddings.

It uses semantic similarity means similarity in meanings of two or more words, where the words may differ and techniques like cosine similarity and dot product are used for matching. Every value is meaningful, based on learned patterns. Every number in the vector has meaning as it represents semantic features, not words. Here most of the values are 1s and there are no or only few 0s. Each number contributes to semantic understanding. Characteristics of Dense Retrieval: 1. Captures Meaning, Not Just Words: Dense models understand language context. For example, it knows that \u201cflu\u201d and \u201cfever\u201d are related even if the exact word isn\u2019t used in both. 2. Requires Model Training: Dense retrieval uses deep learning models like BERT. These models need training on data and powerful hardware (like GPUs) to generate high- quality embeddings. 3. Better for Semantic Search: It can match questions to answers even when the words don\u2019t exactly\nakes them easy to use and fast. Fast, Interpretable, and Effective for Exact Match: because it uses indexing making it ideal for search engines. Sparse retrieval is not limited to text data. Extensions of sparse retrieval approaches to the vision-language domain enable the retrieval of relevant content across different models such as finding images based on text queries. Example: You walk into a supermarket with 10,000 shelves, and each shelf has a different item rice, toothpaste, laptop, pen, etc. You go in just to buy 3 things: milk, bread, and butter; Shelf 1 (rice): 0 Shelf 2 (soap): 0 Shelf 3 (milk): 1 Shelf 4 (bread): 1 Shelf 5 (butter): 1 Shelf 6 (shampoo): 0 \u2026\u2026. Shelf 10,000 (watch): 0 This is your shopping vector and you can see 3 positions have 1s I mean the items you have picked this is called a sparse vector because most of the values are zeros, and only a few are non-zero. Dense Retrieval: Dense retrieval encodes queries and documents into low-dimensional dense vectors (which means that there will be small number of values and at every position in the vector has non-zero and meaningful value) using deep neural networks like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations f\nWeek 1 Research: What is a vector embedding? Why is it used in AI search? A vector embedding is a way to turn words or sentences into numbers so that a computer can understand their meaning, it contributes in finding similar things. Vector embedding are numerical representations of texts, images or other forms of data where each object is transformed into a list of numbers called a vector in a multi-dimensional space, It just means there are many features being tracked at once, each dimension represents specific feature of the data like its meaning, emotion, context. Vectors are nothing but list of numbers, and we need a way to match meanings, not just words, that\u2019s what embeddings do. Let us assume computers as human and the scenario while searching will be, the sentences that are close in terms of meaning, the computer concludes that they\u2019re probably talking about the same thing. Example: Let us suppose Dog\u2019s vector [0.23, 0.99, -0.12, ..., 0.77] and Cat\u2019s vector [0.24, 0.98, -0.11, ..., 0.76], these numbers are called embeddings.

OpenAI Hybrid Search: It scores both the token overlap and cosine similarity of embeddings, then blends the scores, Works very well in real-world apps like knowledge base search, semantic chatbots, or search inside documents. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Developed by Facebook AI, RAG is used for QA and generative tasks. RAG combines A retriever (dense, sparse, or hybrid) to fetch relevant documents and A generator (like GPT or BART) to generate responses using the retrieved docs. Use case: Chatbots, virtual assistants, document QA, LLMs with memory, Users ask long or fuzzy questions Example: User Query: \u201cHow can I treat a headache naturally?\u201d Sparse Retrieval (BM25): Finds 100 documents with the words \u201cheadache\u201d, \u201ctreat\u201d, etc Dense Embeddings: Encodes the query and the 100 docs and then ranks them using semantic similarity(dense). As a result, top 5 documents are passed to a language model or returned as results.\n\nQuestion:\nyour answer is wrong try to fetch again from the knowledge base\n\nAnswer:",

OpenAI Hybrid Search: It scores both the token overlap and cosine similarity of embeddings, then blends the scores, Works very well in real-world apps like knowledge base search, semantic chatbots, or search inside documents. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Developed by Facebook AI, RAG is used for QA and generative tasks. RAG combines A retriever (dense, sparse, or hybrid) to fetch relevant documents and A generator (like GPT or BART) to generate responses using the retrieved docs. Use case: Chatbots, virtual assistants, document QA, LLMs with memory, Users ask long or fuzzy questions Example: User Query: \u201cHow can I treat a headache naturally?\u201d Sparse Retrieval (BM25): Finds 100 documents with the words \u201cheadache\u201d, \u201ctreat\u201d, etc Dense Embeddings: Encodes the query and the 100 docs and then ranks them using semantic similarity(dense). As a result, top 5 documents are passed to a language model or returned as results.",

A vector embedding is a way to turn words or sentences into numbers so that a computer can understand their meaning, it contributes in finding similar things. Vector embedding are numerical representations of texts, images or other forms of data where each object is transformed into a list of numbers called a vector in a multi-dimensional space, It just means there are many features being tracked at once, each dimension represents specific feature of the data like its meaning, emotion, context. Vectors are nothing but list of numbers, and we need a way to match meanings, not just words, that\u2019s what embeddings do. Let us assume computers as human and the scenario while searching will be, the sentences that are close in terms of meaning, the computer concludes that they\u2019re probably talking about the same thing. Example: Let us suppose Dog\u2019s vector [0.23, 0.99, -0.12, ..., 0.77] and Cat\u2019s vector [0.24, 0.98, -0.11, ..., 0.76], these numbers are called embeddings. Each value denotes a feature or characteristic like tail size, color, etc. We teach computers to convert words into numbers in such a way that similar\nwords get similar numbers. As you can observe they are closed in dimensional space i.e. in computer, which means they are semantically similar such that even if the values are different the meaning can be same. Embeddings capture the intent and meaning, not just the words and they convert data into numbers so that computers can understand, compare, and work with them based on meaning, not exact words. It is used in AI as each vector carries semantic meaning of the input, which helps in searching through meaning unlike previously used methods which uses keyword matching which may fail when different words mean the same. The vectors hold properties/ characteristics/features of the object in a form such that it is easily understandable to machine learning models for faster outputs. Example: Bag 1 has its features red colored, medium sized, costs $50, and is from brand Nike i.e. Bag A - [Red, Medium, \u20b9500, Nike] then computer will store and fetch it like Bag A - [0.8, 0.6, 0.7, 0.9] and similarly assume Bag B - [0.7, 0.6, 0.9, 0.3].

It also considers meanings and intent, not just words. Example: Query - \u201cHow to reduce body heat?\u201d It finds matches with \u201cHome remedies for fever\u201d, as you can see the result is based on semantic, not word-to-word. Example: Imagine describing a person in a sentence: \u201cHe is tall, athletic, and friendly.\u201d Now if we write these traits as vectors i.e. [0.8, 0.9, 0.7], Each number represents how strongly that trait appears that is tallness, athleticism, friendliness. This is a dense vector all positions are filled with meaningful values. Even if the two sentences share no exact words, their dense vector embeddings are close, because they mean the same thing.

        "text": "Week 1 Research: What is a vector embedding? Why is it used in AI search? A vector embedding is a way to turn words or sentences into numbers so that a computer can understand their meaning, it contributes in finding similar things. Vector embedding are numerical representations of texts, images or other forms of data where each object is transformed into a list of numbers called a vector in a multi-dimensional space, It just means there are many features being tracked at once, each dimension represents specific feature of the data like its meaning, emotion, context. Vectors are nothing but list of numbers, and we need a way to match meanings, not just words, that\u2019s what embeddings do. Let us assume computers as human and the scenario while searching will be, the sentences that are close in terms of meaning, the computer concludes that they\u2019re probably talking about the same thing. Example: Let us suppose Dog\u2019s vector [0.23, 0.99, -0.12, ..., 0.77] and Cat\u2019s vector [0.24, 0.98, -0.11, ..., 0.76], these numbers are called embeddings. Each value denotes a feature or characteristic like tail size, color, etc. We teach computers to convert words into numbers in such a way that similar",

        "text": "words get similar numbers. As you can observe they are closed in dimensional space i.e. in computer, which means they are semantically similar such that even if the values are different the meaning can be same. Embeddings capture the intent and meaning, not just the words and they convert data into numbers so that computers can understand, compare, and work with them based on meaning, not exact words. It is used in AI as each vector carries semantic meaning of the input, which helps in searching through meaning unlike previously used methods which uses keyword matching which may fail when different words mean the same. The vectors hold properties/ characteristics/features of the object in a form such that it is easily understandable to machine learning models for faster outputs. Example: Bag 1 has its features red colored, medium sized, costs $50, and is from brand Nike i.e. Bag A - [Red, Medium, \u20b9500, Nike] then computer will store and fetch it like Bag A - [0.8, 0.6, 0.7, 0.9] and similarly assume Bag B - [0.7, 0.6, 0.9, 0.3]. We can now assume that they are closely related. Vector embeddings help AI by turning meaning into numbers, so it can compare, understand what we meant, ev",

LangChain: LangChain is a Python framework for building applications using LLMs like GPT and embeddings. It allows you to connect OpenAI embeddings with vector DBs (FAISS, Pinecone, Weaviate) and build RAG (retrieval augmented generation) apps. LlamaIndex (formerly GPT Index): LlamaIndex is a data framework that helps connect your structured/unstructured data (docs, PDFs, SQL, APIs) to LLMs using embeddings. Indexing large text data, Connects with OpenAI, FAISS, Pinecone, Weaviate. HuggingFace: A Python library that provides thousands of pre-trained models for tasks like classification meaning assigning a category to text, translation, and embedding gener\nation that is turning a sentence into a vector that represent its meaning. Tools in HuggingFace Transformers Library The flagship library of Hugging Face that gives access to thousands of pretrained models based on transformer architecture. These models are trained on massive datasets and solve various NLP, vision, and audio tasks. Plug-and-play access to models like BERT, GPT, RoBERTa, T5, etc. Supported Tasks: Sentiment Analysis, Text Generation, Translation Multi-framework: supports PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX. Sentence-Transformers Library An extension of Transformers, designed to produce high-quality sentence embeddings for measuring semantic similarity between texts. Regular transformer models (like BERT) output token-level vectors, not complete sentence-level embeddings. Sentence-transformers fine-tune BERT-like models to output a single fixed-size vector per sentence. Use cases: Paraphrase Mining, Similarity Score Calculation. Popular Models: all-MiniLM-L6-v2, paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2, multi-qa-MiniLM-*.\nt instead of matching full vectors at once, it matches tokens separately, enabling scalable semantic search. In hybrid use, ColBERTv2 is often paired with BM25 for initial filtering, then it re-ranks with semantic scoring. 2. OpenAI Hybrid Search: It scores both the token overlap and cosine similarity of embeddings, then blends the scores, Works very well in real-world apps like knowledge base search, semantic chatbots, or search inside documents. 3. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Developed by Facebook AI, RAG is used for QA and generative tasks.

Hans Christian Oersted (1777\u20131851) Hans Christian Oersted, one of the leading scientists of the 19th century, played a crucial role in understanding electromagnetism. In 1820 he accidentally discovered that a compass needle got deflected when an electric current passed through a metallic wire placed nearby. Through this observation Oersted showed that electricity and magnetism were related phenomena. His research later created technologies such as the radio, television and fiber optics.

Its one end, which points towards north, is called a north pole, and the other end, which points towards south, is called a south pole. n A magnetic field exists in the region surrounding a magnet, in which the force of the magnet can be detected. n Field lines are used to represent a magnetic field. A field line is the path along which a hypothetical free north pole would tend to move. The direction of the magnetic field at a point is given by the direction that a north pole placed at that point would take.

It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.\n\nKey Features\n\nPython is dynamically typed and garbage-collected, making it flexible and easy to use.

        "text": "A non-procedural language is a type of programming language where the user specifies what the program should accomplish without detailing how to achieve it, allowing the underlying system to determine the execution process.\nCharacteristics of Non-Procedural Languages\nDeclarative Approach: Non-procedural languages, also known as declarative languages, focus on defining the desired outcomes rather than the specific steps to reach those outcomes. This approach allows for more concise and expressive code \n2\n.\nFunction Development: These languages enable the creation of complex functions from simpler, existing functions. This means that coding is often shorthand for specifying relationships, constraints, or operations \n2\n.\nSimplicity: The semantics of non-procedural languages tend to be simpler compared to procedural languages. This simplicity can lead to improved readability and easier maintenance of code \n2\n.\nAutomatic Optimization: The underlying systems can often optimize execution automatically, which helps in achieving better performance without requiring manual optimization by the developer \n1\n.\n\n\n4 Sources\nExamples of Non-Procedural Languages\nSQL (Structured Query Language): Used for managing and querying relational databases, SQL allows users to request data without needing to specify the exact retrieval method.\nLISP: A language primarily used in artificial intelligence, known for its symbolic expression capabilities and functional programming features.\nPROLOG: A logic programming language that emphasizes the use of rules and facts to perform logical inference \n2\n.\n\n\n2 Sources\nAdvantages of Non-Procedural Languages\nHigher Productivity: Since these languages allow developers to focus on what needs to be done rather than how to do it, they can often produce results more quickly and efficiently.\nEnhanced Readability: The focus on outcomes makes non-procedural code easier to read and understand, even for those unfamiliar with the original code \n2\n.\nEasier Maintenance: Non-procedural languages often lead to less complex code, which reduces the likelihood of bugs and makes maintenance simpler \n2\n.\n\n\n3 Sources\nConclusion\nNon-procedural languages represent a significant departure from traditional procedural programming paradigms. By focusing on the end goal rather than the means of achieving it, these languages enable developers to write more abstract, efficient, and maintainable code. They are particularly useful in scenarios where the requirements can be clearly defined without needing to delve into implementation details.\nThese features make non-procedural languages an excellent choice for specific applications, particularly in database management, artificial intelligence, and high-level data manipulation tasks.",
